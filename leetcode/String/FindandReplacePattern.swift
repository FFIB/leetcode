//890. Find and Replace Pattern
/*
 You have a list of words and a pattern, and you want to know which words in words matches the pattern.

 A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.

 (Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.)

 Return a list of the words in words that match the given pattern.

 You may return the answer in any order.



 Example 1:

 Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
 Output: ["mee","aqq"]
 Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
 "ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation,
 since a and b map to the same letter.


 Note:

 1 <= words.length <= 50
 1 <= pattern.length = words[i].length <= 20

                rules[v] = [i]
            }
