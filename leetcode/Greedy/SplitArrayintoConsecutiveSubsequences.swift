//659. Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences
/*
 You are given an integer array sorted in ascending order (may contain duplicates), you need to split them into several subsequences, where each subsequences consist of at least 3 consecutive integers. Return whether you can make such a split.

 Example 1:
 Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]
 Output: True
 Explanation:
 You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
 1, 2, 3
 3, 4, 5
 Example 2:
 Input: [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5]
 Output: True
 Explanation:
 You can split them into two consecutive subsequences :
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
 3, 4, 5
 Example 3:
 Input: [1,2,3,4,4,5]
 Output: False
 Note:
 The length of the input is in range of [1, 10000]
